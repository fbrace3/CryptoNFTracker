Our app connects to the CoinMarketCap, Google, and BlockSpan NFT collections api, and allows a user to track favorite cryptocurrency and NFT's.  It also includes a "Bank Finder" that locates all banks whithin a 5 mile radius of the users location.  The user also has the option to "verify" their status with a photo in the settings fragment.

When logging in the User has the option to register a new user(which will be persisted) or to enter admin/admin for instant access.  We utilized a nav drawer as well as a bottom menu for easy navigation between the fragments.

We mainly utilized github copiolet and ChatGPT, but we also referenced stack overflow, github, and a number of other websites.
